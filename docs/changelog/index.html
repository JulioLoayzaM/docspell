<p><em>Oct 27, 2021</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Share items (#446). Allows to create shares, public cryptic links,
to a subset of your documents that can be shared with other people
(who don't need an account). It is possible to search inside the
shared subset. Shares have a lifetime and can be password protected.</li>
<li>Support encrypted PDFs (#1074). When importing PDF files, the
protection layer (usually for signed PDFs) is being removed in order
to process it. The config file and collective settings can now
define a list of passwords that are being used when trying to
decrypt encrypted PDFs.</li>
<li>Use environment variables to configure Docspell instead of a config
file (#1121). This is mainly intended when running via docker or
other similar tools. Note that settings that accept list as its
values are not yet supported.</li>
<li>Try to detect the best way to render PDFs (#1099). Mobile browsers
need a fallback for rendering PDFs, but desktop browsers can do it
much better natively. The user settings allow to decide how to
render a PDF or to let docspell detect it.</li>
<li>Filter possible values in search menu based on current results
(#856). This removes options that would only yield empty results
from the dropdowns.</li>
<li>Fix search in documenation (#1120)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rest-api-changes">Rest API Changes<a class="zola-anchor" href="#rest-api-changes" aria-label="Anchor link for: rest-api-changes">🔗</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>/share/*</code> routes to access a share</li>
<li><code>/open/share/verify</code> routes to verify a share id</li>
<li><code>/sec/share/*</code> routes to manage shares</li>
<li>extend <code>SearchStats</code> to include correspondents/concerning numbers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration-changes">Configuration Changes<a class="zola-anchor" href="#configuration-changes" aria-label="Anchor link for: configuration-changes">🔗</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>restserver: changed the server secret from the (dummy) value
<code>hex:caffee</code> to an empty string. This results in a random secret
generated at application start. It is recommended to set it to some
random value, otherwise sessions don't survive server restarts.</li>
<li>joex: adds a section <code>decrypt-pdf</code> for specifying a list of
passwords to try when encountering encrypted PDFs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v0-27-0">v0.27.0<a class="zola-anchor" href="#v0-27-0" aria-label="Anchor link for: v0-27-0">🔗</a></h2>
<p><em>Sep 23, 2021</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Allow external authentication providers via <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID
Connect</a>. Now you can integrate Docspell
into your SSO solution. Using keycloak, for example (or other such
tools) users can be maintained elsewhere, like in an LDAP directory.
(#489)</li>
<li>Adds two-factor authentication using TOTPs. If you don't want to
setup an external authentication provider (which is another tool to
maintain), you can use the builtin TOTP support to have two-factor
authentication. (#762)</li>
<li>Improvements when querying documents (#1040)</li>
<li>Changed the underlying code for storing and loading files. This is a
preparation to allow different storage backends for files in the
future (maybe the filesystem or s3). (#1080)</li>
<li>The license has changed from GPLv3+ to AGPLv3+ (#1078)</li>
<li>Fixes a bug in the &quot;check for updates&quot; task that was added in the
last release (#1068)</li>
<li>Reduces the length of the startup command, which makes tools like
<code>ps</code> much more readable and allows now to start docspell on Windows
(untested, though ;-)) (#1062)</li>
<li>Fixes merging items, where sent mails were not copied to the target
item. (#1055)</li>
<li>Fixes and improves deleting users. Now all their data is also
removed and it is shown what that would be. (#1060)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rest-api-changes-1">Rest API Changes<a class="zola-anchor" href="#rest-api-changes-1" aria-label="Anchor link for: rest-api-changes-1">🔗</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <code>login</code> routes now won't return a session token when 2FA is
enabled for an account. The returned token must be used to provide
the TOTP in order to finalize login.</li>
<li>Added <code>open/auth/two-factor</code> endpoint to provide the TOTP for login</li>
<li>Added <code>open/auth/openid/{providerId}[/resume]</code> endpoints to initiate
authentication via an external provider</li>
<li>Added <code>sec/user/{username}/deleteData</code> to retrieve a summary of data
that would be deleted with that user</li>
<li>Added <code>sec/user/otp/*</code> endpoints to manage the TOTP for an account</li>
<li>Added <code>admin/user/otp/reserOTP</code> to reset the 2FA setup for any user</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration-changes-1">Configuration Changes<a class="zola-anchor" href="#configuration-changes-1" aria-label="Anchor link for: configuration-changes-1">🔗</a></h3>

<li>Restserver: Added a section to configure external authentication
provider</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v0-26-0">v0.26.0<a class="zola-anchor" href="#v0-26-0" aria-label="Anchor link for: v0-26-0">🔗</a></h2>
<p><em>Aug 28, 2021</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Add ability to merge items (#414). You can now select multiple items
and merge them all into one. The first item in the list is the
target item, all others are deleted after a successful merge. The
webapp allows to reorder this list, of course.</li>
<li>Add option to only import attachments of e-mails (#983). </li>
<li>Improve <em>Manage Data</em> page by sorting the tables (#965, #538)</li>
<li>Allow wildcard searches in queries using <code>attach.id</code> (#971). Before
you would have to specify the complete id. This is inconvenient when
using from the command line client.</li>
<li>Add Hebrew to the document languages (#1027, thans @wallace11).
Please note, that the SOLR support is very basic for this language.</li>
<li>Add a periodic task to check for Docspell updates (#990). Let's you
check periodically for new versions of docspell. It uses an existing
user account and its mail settings to send an e-mail.</li>
<li>Show the link to an item and its attachments as a QR code in item
details (#836). This might be useful when you want to attach this
link to physical devices.</li>
<li>The search menu highlights the sections that contain active filters
(#966)</li>
<li>Safe deletion of items (#347). When deleting items, they are now
<em>marked as deleted</em> and can therefore be restored. A periodic job
will really delete them from the database eventually.</li>
<li>Improves German translation (#985, thanks @monnypython)</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/docspell/dsc">dsc</a> tool has also been
improved, thanks to @seijikun.</li>
<li>Upgrade the website to work with newer zola versions (#847)</li>
<li>Remove the scripts in <code>tools/</code> since these are now obsolete. The new
<a href="https://github.com/docspell/dsc">command line interface</a> covers
these features now. Note that the docker images are also NOT built
anymore. The directory still exits and is still a place for scripts
and little tooling around docspell.</li>
<li>Fixes a regression where the browser would not display the pdf (#975)</li>
<li>Fixes the health checks in the docker setup (#976)</li>
<li>Fixes an issue with text extraction for Japanese documents where
numbers were extracted as special unicode points (#973). This only
affects the docker setup, when not using the docker images you need
to setup tesseract to use different training data for Japanese.</li>

<li>Added <code>/sec/item/{id}/restore</code> to restore a trashed item (unless it
has been deleted from the database).</li>
<li>Added <code>/sec/items/restoreAll</code> to restore multiple of trashed items</li>
<li>Added <code>/sec/items/merge</code> that accepts a POST request with a list of
items to merge. The first item is the &quot;target&quot; item. All other items
are deleted after the merge was successful.</li>
<li>The <code>ScanMailboxSettings</code>, <code>Source</code> and <code>ItemUploadMeta</code> structures
now contains a boolean field <code>attachmentsOnly</code></li>

<p><em>Jun 18, 2021</em></p>
<p>This time a translation of the Web-UI in German is included and the
docker build was overhauled. The releases are now build and tested
using Java 11.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rework Docker setup. Images are now provided for different
architectures and have a new home now (see below). The images are
now built via a github-action from the official packages of each
release. (#635, #643, #840, #687)</li>
<li>Translation of the UI into German (thanks to @monnypython for proof
reading and applying lots of corrections!) (#292, #683, #870)</li>
<li>Improve migration of SOLR (#604)
<ul>
<li>The information whether solr has been setup, is now stored inside
SOLR. This means when upgrading Docspell, all data will be
re-indexed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add <code>--exclude</code> and <code>--include</code> options to the <code>consumedir.sh</code>
script (#885)</li>
<li>Improved documenation of the http api (#874)</li>
<li>Removed unused libraries in the final packages to reduce file size a
bit (#841)</li>
<li>Bug: Searching by tag category was broken when using upper case
letters (#849)</li>
<li>Bug: when adding a boolean custom field, it must be applied
immediatly (#842)</li>
<li>Bug: when entering a space in a dropdown the menu closes (#863)</li>
<li>Bug: Some scripts didn't work with earlier versions of <code>jq</code> (#851)</li>
<li>Bug: The source form was broken in that it didn't load the language
correctly (#877)</li>
<li>Bug: Tag category options were wrongly populated when narrowing tags
via a search (#880)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes<a class="zola-anchor" href="#breaking-changes" aria-label="Anchor link for: breaking-changes">🔗</a></h3>
<h4 id="java-11">Java 11<a class="zola-anchor" href="#java-11" aria-label="Anchor link for: java-11">🔗</a></h4>
<p>Not really a breaking change. Docspell is now build and tested using
Java 11. Docspell has a small amount of Java source code. This is
compiled using Java 11 but to target Java 8 JVMs. So it still can run
under Java 8. However, it is recommended to use at least Java 11 to
run Docspell.</p>
<h4 id="docker-images">Docker Images<a class="zola-anchor" href="#docker-images" aria-label="Anchor link for: docker-images">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The docker images are now pushed to the
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/docspell">docspell</a> organization at
docker-hub! So the images are now:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>docspell/restserver</code></li>
<li><code>docspell/joex</code></li>
<li><code>docspell/tools</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Tags: images are tagged with two floating tags: <code>nightly</code> and
<code>latest</code>. The <code>nightly</code> tag always points to the latest development
state (the master branch). The <code>latest</code> tag points to the latest
release. Each release is also tagged with its version number, like
<code>v0.24.0</code>.</p>
<p>The images changed slightly in that there is no assumption on where
the config file is placed. Now you need to pass the docspell config
file explicitely when using the images.</p>
<p>Multiarch: Images are now build for <code>amd64</code>, <code>arm64</code> and <code>armv7</code>.</p>
<p>The consumedir is being replaced by the more generic <code>docspell/tools</code>
image which contains all the scripts from the <code>tools/</code> section. That
means it has no special entrypoint for the consumedir script anymore.
The polling functionality is now provided by the consumedir script.
And the docker-compose file needs now to specify the complete command
arguments. This makes it much more flexible to use.</p>
<p>This allows to use this image to run all the other tool scripts, too.
The scripts are in PATH inside the image and prefixed by <code>ds-</code>, so for
example <code>ds-consumedir</code> or <code>ds-export-files</code> etc.</p>
<h4 id="docker-compose">Docker Compose<a class="zola-anchor" href="#docker-compose" aria-label="Anchor link for: docker-compose">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The docker-compose setup is now at <code>docker/docker-compose</code>. Please
look at the new <a href="https://github.com/eikek/docspell/blob/master/docker/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml">compose
file</a>
and do the corresponding changes at yours. Especially the consumedir
container changed significantly. Then due to the fact that the config
file must be given explicitely, you need to add this argument to each
docspell component (restserver and joex) via a <code>command</code> section (see
the compose file referenced above).</p>
<p>The <code>.envrc</code> has been cleaned from some settings. Since the config
files is mounted into the image, you can just edit this file instead.
The only settings left in the .envrc file are those that need to be
available in the docker-compose file and the application. If some
settings need to be duplicated for joex and restserver, you can use
the builtin variable resolution mechanism for this. An example is
provided in the new config file.</p>

<p><em>May 29, 2021</em></p>
<p>This release enables deleting multiple files at once of an item. It
also changes how user settings are stored. Additionally several bugs
in the ui and server have been fixed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature: Central user settings (#565): user settings have been
stored in the browser but are now stored at the server. This means
that all settings are now shared across all devices. See below for
notes on migrating your current settings.</li>
<li>Feature: Delete multiple attachemnts at once, thanks to
@stefan-scheidewig (#626): multiple attachments on an item can be
deleted with a single click</li>
<li>Feature: Make consumedir-cleaner run on windows, thanks to
@JaCoB1123 (#809)</li>
<li>Bug: More work externalizing strings (#784, #760): many more strings
have been externalized for being translated; also dates are now
externalized, too</li>
<li>Bug: Better anonymous upload page (#758): the upload page for
anonymous users shouldn't show a form to provide any metadata</li>
<li>Bug: Tag category color (#835): the input field to specify colors

<p>After the upgrade to this version, your current ui settings are not
read anymore. That means docspell starts up with a light theme and tag
colors are gone etc. If there are no settings at the server, but
docspell finds some at your browser, the <em>UI Settings</em> page shows a
big message and a button. Clicking this button sends your settings to
the server. This message disappears as soon as there are some settings
on the server.</p>
<p>If you have multiple devices, you now need to choose one which
settings you want to migrate to the server. It is currently not
possible to store settings per device.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: the button is only there if there are no settings at the
server. So if you want to migrate, don't set the theme or click on
other things that are persisted before doing the migration!</em></p>

Additionally there are some other minor features and bug fixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Web-UI with light and dark theme (#293).

still available as a fallback if something got missing while
porting. The old ui will be removed in the next release.</li>
<li>Experience on mobile devices is greatly improved</li>
<li>to get back to the old ui, you need to install a browser extension
to be able to add a request header. Check <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/modheader-firefox/">this for
firefox</a>
or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj">this for

<p>This release comes with major improvements to the text analysis
module. It is now much more configurable, has improved results and can
learn tags from all categories. Additionally, more languages for
document processing have been added and it's now easier to add more.
Please open an issue if want more languages to be included.</p>
<ul>
<li>text analysis improvements (#263, #570)
<ul>
<li>docspell can now learn from all your tag categories</li>
<li>the detection for correspondents/concerned entities has been
improved by using the classifier for this, too</li>
<li>all text analysis steps are now configurable that makes it
possible to adapt it better to your data and machine. </li>
<li>The docs have been updated with some details
<a href="https://docspell.org/docs/configure/#file-processing">here</a> and
<a href="https://docspell.org/docs/joex/file-processing/#text-analysis">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>more languages (#488)
<ul>
<li>Adds: Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, Danish, Finnish,
Norwegian, Swedish, Russian, Romanian</li>
<li>languages have different support for text-analysis, but there is
some basic support for all</li>
<li>there is extended support for English, German and French through
<a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/">Stanford CoreNLP</a> nlp
models (as before)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>scan mailbox change (#576)
<ul>
<li>The change from last version (#551) has been moved behind a flag
in the &quot;scan mailbox settings&quot;. Please review your scan mailbox
tasks in your user settings.</li>
<li>The scan mailbox settings form view has been organized into tabs,
as it grew too large for a single form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nix tools package fixed (#584)
<ul>
<li>If you are using docspell tools package for nix, it has now been
fixed in that all scripts are available. They are now all prefixed
by <code>ds-</code> (except the <code>ds</code> script)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fix deleting organization (#578)
<ul>
<li>Due to the new relationship of a person to an organization,
deleting an organization whith references a person was not
possible. This is now fixed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>base url fix (#579)
<ul>
<li>The <code>baseurl</code> setting is optional, but when specified it was
required to omit a trailing slash. This is now fixed in that it is
always rendered without the trailing slash to the client, no
matter what is in the config</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tag category case sensitive search fix (#568)
<ul>
<li>This was a bug introduced by the last release. When tag categories
can now be spelled upper- or lower-case. In 0.18.0 you had to
spell them lowercase, otherwise the search doesn't work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>adds a workaround for mails that don't specify their used charset (#591)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-1">Breaking Changes<a class="zola-anchor" href="#breaking-changes-1" aria-label="Anchor link for: breaking-changes-1">🔗</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The joex configuration changed around text analysis. If you had some
custom settings there, please review these wrt the new default
config.</li>
<li>When using the nix package manager: the tools package renamed the
scripts to be better distinguishable, since they all end up in
<code>$PATH</code>. They are now prefixed by <code>ds-</code>.</li>
<li>The path of the consumedir script changed in the consumedir docker
image</li>
<li>The settings of the scan-mailbox task has been extended by another
flag. It controls when to apply the post-processing (moving or
deleting). If you were relying that all mails (even those excluded
by a subject filter) where moved away, you need to check your
scan-mailbox task settings.</li>

<p><em>Jan 11, 2021</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Feature: Results summary and updated tag count (#496, #333)
<ul>
<li>A search summary can be displayed that shows the overall result
count and to each custom field with a numeric type (number or
money) small statistics like sum, average and max/min values. This
is useful when you track your expenses on invoices or receipts.</li>
<li>This additional ui element can be enabled/disabled in your ui
settings.</li>
<li>The result summary is now also used to update the tag counts in
the search menu according to the current results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feature: password reset (#376,
<a href="https://docspell.org/docs/tools/cli/#admin-commands">docs</a>)
<ul>
<li>Adds a new route for admins to reset the password of a user</li>
<li>Admin users are those with access to the config file, the endpoint
requires to supply a secret from the config file.</li>
<li>A bash script is provided for more convenient access.</li>
<li><em>Note this also moves the re-create index endpoint behind the same
secret!</em> See below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feature: custom fields clickable (#514)
<ul>
<li>The item detail view allows to click on tags to quickly find all
tagged items. This now works for custom fields, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feature: scroll independently (#541)
<ul>
<li>The search menu can scroll now independent from the main area
containing the item cards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement: improve attachment selection (#396)
<ul>
<li>When selecting an attachment, it shows its preview to the name
instead of the name only</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement: wildcard search for custom date fields (#550)
<ul>
<li>Searching for custom field values allows to use a wildcard <code>*</code> at
beginning or end. This is also enabled for date-fields.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement: joex memory (#509)
<ul>
<li>Joex currently requires a lot of memory to hold the NLP models.
After idling for some time, which can be configured and defaults
to 15 min, the NLP model cache is cleared. This reduces memory
load and makes it possible for the JVM to give it back to the OS.</li>
<li>This is supposed to relieve memory consumption when idling only.
However, whether it is reclaimed by the OS depends on the JVM and
its settings. To observe it early, use the G1GC garbage collector.
This is enabled by default for JDK11. So it is recommended to use
JDK11 (which is used in the docker images).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement: allow scaling joex with docker-compose, thanks @bjeanes
(#552)
<ul>
<li>This allows to easily start multiple joex containers via
<code>docker-compose</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement: allow to connect with gmail via app specific passwords
(#520)
<ul>
<li>Imap settings have been extended to be able to specify if a OAuth2
should be used or not.</li>
<li>Before, OAuth2 was the default when the server has advertised it.
<em>This has been changed now, which means you need to adapt your
IMAP settings if you currently use OAuth2</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix: provide multiple possible date suggestions for English
documents (#561)</li>
<li>Fix: add missing language files to joex docker image (#525)</li>
<li>Fix: fix a bug that occurs when processing is restarted (i.e. after
a crash) (#530)</li>
<li>Fix: fix a bug in the ui where the mail connection field was not
correctly updated (#524)</li>

<p><em>Dec 14, 2020</em></p>
<p>This release comes with some smaller features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature: Remember-Me – another cookie is used to provide a
remember-me functionality. The cookie is checked against some value
in the database, so an admin can always make all remember-me cookies
invalid. (#435)</li>
<li>Feature: Link persons to organizations. In the address book, a
person can now be associated to an organzition. The dropdowns show a
little hint for which organization a person belongs to. Also
suggestions for persons are restricted to those of the organization
if that has been associated before. (#375)</li>
<li>Feature: Allow to filter on source names. The search form can now
search by a source name. The new field can be hidden via ui settings
(it must be activated for exising users). (#390)</li>
<li>Feature: Customize the title and subtitle of the item card in the
overview. You can now define patterns for the title and subtitle of
a card. (#429)</li>
<li>Feature: Export your data. A bash script has been added that goes
through your items and downloads them all to disk (including their
metadata!). This can be used to periodically backup the data in
docspell.</li>
<li>Improvement: The webui has been improved in that the search bar and
search form are unified regarding the text search. The two fields in
the form, allowing to search in names and fulltext, have been
combined into a single field just as the search bar. (#497)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the last release for 2020. I had hoped to put more into this,
but this time of the year is always a busy one ;-). I want to thank
you for your support and interest in this project and I wish you all a
joyful Christmas time!</p>

<ul>
<li>Feature: Custom Fields – define custom metadata fields an set values
for them on your items. For example, this can be used to track
invoice numbers, pagination stamps etc. Fields can be defined per
collective and carry a format (or type). (#41)</li>
<li>Feature: The language has been added to the metadata of an upload
request and therefore overrides the collective's default language.
This means you can now set the document language with each document.
(#350)</li>
<li>Feature: Show the currently logged in user and the collective in the
web app. (#329)</li>
<li>Feature: Tag categories are presented as a dropdown, where you can
choose an existing one or type a new one. (#331)</li>
<li>Feature: The dropdown fields for a person have been changed in that
the options are now restricted to the corresponding scope: the
correspondent person only shows persons <em>not</em> marked as concerning
and vice-versa. (#332)</li>
<li>Feature: Add CC and BCC recipients to item mail (#481)</li>

<p>This release adds the &quot;preview feature&quot;, where a thumbnail of the
first page of each attachment can be shown in the overview. Additional
there are some bugfixes and UI improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature: create a thumbnail of every file. The scale factor can be
configured in the config file. The user can choose in the ui, what
size to display and whether to display it or not. (#327)</li>
<li>Feature: Display the number of pages in the overview (#325)</li>
<li>Feature: Extend the upload request to allow to specify a file filter
and a list of tags (#346, #385):
<ul>
<li>file filter: this is a glob that selects files when an archive
file (a zip or e-mail file) is uploaded</li>
<li>tag list: allows to specify a list of tags that are automatically
set on the item that is being created</li>
<li>these two settings are added to the scan-mailbox form and the
source-form</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feature: Filter mails to import by subject (#384)</li>
<li>Feature: Add quick links to item-detail and overview to jump to a
specific search view; e.g. click on correspondent takes you to the
overview with this correspondent selected in the search menu (#355)</li>
<li>Improved css assets (#349)
<ul>
<li>Moved from <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic-UI</a> to
<a href="https://fomantic-ui.com/">Fomantic-UI</a>, which is an actively
maintained fork of the former</li>
<li>Removed the request to obtain a google font. Now you can use
docspell without hassle in environments without internet
connection</li>
<li>jquery could be dropped as a js dependency</li>
<li>This is a foundation for adding/changing themes eventually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved ui for multi select mode when selecting items</li>
<li>Fix a bug when creating new scan-mailbox settings (#382)</li>
<li>Fix a build issue that resulted in missing scripts in the tools zip
file.</li>
<li>Fix a bug that added the <code>.pdf</code> extension twice. The filename can
now be defined in the config file. (#397)</li>

<p>This release contains bugfixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to the docker setup: application can be build from any
version. Thanks to @totti4ever.
<ul>
<li>This change required breaking changes in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code>
file. Please update your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> to the new version.</li>
<li>The image tags changed:
<ul>
<li>the <code>-latest</code> is now upper case, <code>-LATEST</code></li>
<li>tagged releases include the version prefixed with a <code>v</code>, like in
<code>-v0.13.0</code></li>
<li>there are new <code>-SNAPSHOT</code> images that are build from the current
master branch. <em>Please note that snapshot versions may not be
compatible with each other!</em></li>
</ul>

<li>The date extraction tried to create invalid dates (#298)</li>
<li>Fixed order of job log entries that was undefined if entries were
written very fast</li>
<li>Fix <code>content</code> column for MariaDB (#297)</li>
<li>Fixe regarding retrying processing of files: attached files were not
correctly found and the duplicate check must not run</li>
<li>When &quot;home-page&quot; is rendered, do an initial search. This updates the
view correctly if something changed when coming from item details.</li>
<li>Reset upload page on init (#294)</li>
<li>Fixes regarding <code>base-url</code> setting and auth cookie (#308)</li>

<p><em>Sep 28, 2020</em></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of great input from users, this release fixes
annoyances in the ui.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve startup experience wrt the <code>base-url</code> setting. Docspell now
uses request headers to determine absolute urls if this setting is
unchanged. (#250)</li>
<li>Fixes scrolling issues when going from detail to list view and vice
versa. (#254)</li>
<li>Fix quick search component to keep search term between changes.
(#261)</li>
<li>Docspell now provides a valid manifest to be an installable &quot;pwa&quot;.</li>
<li>Fixes <code>consumedir.sh</code> script to work with whitespace in filenames.
(#269)</li>
<li>Fix hidden fields feature. Hidden fields are now resetted when
clicking <em>Confirm</em>. (#256)</li>
<li>Improve <em>Save Name</em> in item detail: The save button is removed and
changes are saved while typing. (#255)</li>
<li>Add keyboard shortcuts in item detail for navigating and
confirm/unconfirm. (#225)</li>
<li>Detect duplicate files server side. The processing task is now able
to detect duplicate files to skip them if desired. The ui has a new
checkbox when uploading. (#252)</li>
<li>Improve view of many attachments to an item: The tab menu is
replaced by a dropdown menu that allows to change attachments also
on small screens and/or when there are many attachments.</li>

<p><em>Sep 07, 2020</em></p>
<p>This release didn't change much on the surface, but contains a lot of
improvements for processing files.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves the recognition of correspondents and people in the
documents. Until now, the analyser didn't know about the existing
organizations/people of a collective. Now this data is given to the
analyser as input which results in a higher accuracy when finding
matches. This may result in high memory usage depending on the size
of the collective data and therefore can be disabled in the config
file.</li>
<li>Adds text classification. Docspell can now learn from your existing
tagged items. Given a tag category, a statistical model is created
from your existing documents and used to predict a tag (of that
category) for new documents. Creating this model may need a lot of
memory and therefore text classification can be disabled globally
via the config file. Additionally each collective can enable/disable
it. Learning is done periodically via a user-task that can be
configured in the collective settings.</li>
<li>Adds the language french, supported for text extraction and text
analysis. </li>
<li>Fixes some build failures that produced artifcats with source files.</li>
<li>Change the job priority of any waiting job from the <em>Processing</em>
page.</li>
<li>Serving static asset files gzipped, to reduce bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration-changes-16">Configuration Changes<a class="zola-anchor" href="#configuration-changes-16" aria-label="Anchor link for: configuration-changes-16">🔗</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>New settings in <code>joex.analysis.regex-ner</code>, <code>….classification</code> and
<code>….working-dir</code> for the classifier and NER feature.</li>
<li>New setting in <code>server.show-classification-settings</code> to hide/show
the classifier settings on the <em>Collective Settings</em> page. If
classification is disabled globally (i.e. from all joex instances),
the feature can be hidden from the users.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rest-api-changes-17">REST Api Changes<a class="zola-anchor" href="#rest-api-changes-17" aria-label="Anchor link for: rest-api-changes-17">🔗</a></h3>
<ul>

separately from the schedule.</li>
<li><code>/sec/queue/{id}/priority</code> for setting a new priority of a job (only
for jobs in waiting state)</li>
<li>The <code>CollectiveSettings</code> object is amended with a new
<code>ClassifierSetting</code> object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v0-10-0">v0.10.0<a class="zola-anchor" href="#v0-10-0" aria-label="Anchor link for: v0-10-0">🔗</a></h2>
<p><em>Aug 15, 2020</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of web ui improvements:
<ul>
<li>Rework the search menu for <a href="https://docspell.org/docs/webapp/finding/#tags-tag-categories">tags and
folders</a>:
The dropdown field is removed for tags and folders. They are
represented as a list and items can be cycled through to be
included/excluded or deselected. It is possible to use
drag-and-drop to associate tags to items and put items into
folders.</li>
<li>Rework page that displays sources; allow to copy the urls and add
a qr code</li>
<li>Add item notes to the cards in the list view, can be configured if
it is shown or not (#186, #201)</li>
<li>Improve how the item notes are displayed in the item detail view
(#186, #192)</li>
<li>Fix the <em>Load more…</em> button</li>
<li>Allow to search by tag categories (#203)</li>
<li>Allow to edit metadata in item detail view. Until now it was only
possible to add new metadata (#205)</li>
<li>Do not cover the whole screen with the metadata modal dialog, only
the menu is now covered so that it is possible to select text from
the document (#205)</li>
<li>Allow to hide some fields from the menus. What fields to display
can be configured in the ui settings (#195)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implemented some routes that were specified in the openapi, but have
not been implemented so far</li>
<li>Fix source upload routes where it didn't check whether a source is
enabled or not. Further checks are now done as first step to not
upload the file into memory for nothing if something fails (e.g. the
source doesn't exist)</li>
<li>Re-process files. A
<a href="https://docspell.org/openapi/docspell-openapi.html#operation/sec-item-start-reprocess">route</a>
has been added that submits files for re-processing. It is possible
to re-process some files of an item or all. There is no UI for this
for now. You'd need to run <code>curl</code> or something manually to trigger
it. It will replace all extracted metadata of the <em>files</em>,but
doesn't touch the metadata of the item. (#206)</li>
<li>Add a task to convert all pdfs using the
<a href="https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF">OCRMyPdf</a> tool that can be
used in docspell since the last release. This task converts all your
existing PDFs into a PDF/A type pdf including the OCR-ed text layer.
There is no UI to trigger this task, but a script is provided to
help with it. (#206)</li>
<li>There is now an <a href="https://github.com/docspell/android-client">Android Client
App</a> to conveniently
upload files from your android devices</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration-changes-17">Configuration Changes<a class="zola-anchor" href="#configuration-changes-17" aria-label="Anchor link for: configuration-changes-17">🔗</a></h3>

<li>Added <code>/sec/item/convertallpdfs</code> to trigger a task for converting
all currently unconverted pdfs</li>
<li>Added <code>/sec/item/{id}/taglink</code> for associating tags given by name or

<p><em>Aug 1st, 2020</em></p>
<ul>
<li>New feature: folders. Users can create folders and put items into
them. Folders can have members (users of the collective) and search
results are restricted to items that are in no folder or in a folder
where current user is a member. (see #21)</li>
<li>Folders can be given to the upload request.</li>
<li>Add ocrmypdf utility to convert pdf-&gt;pdf with ocr-ed text layer.</li>
<li>Extract PDF metadata and use the <em>keywords</em> to search for tags and
apply them to the item during processing. (See #175)</li>

<ul>
<li>Adds the <a href="https://docspell.org/docs/webapp/finding/#full-text-search">full-text
search</a>
feature (see #69). It requires a separate
<a href="https://solr.apache.org">Solr</a> instance. Items can be searched by
documents contents and item/file names. It is possible to use
full-text search to further confine the results via the search menu.</li>
<li>Fixes column types for item date and due-date for MariaDB (see #158)
and adds an upper limit for due-dates (which is configurable).</li>
<li>Fixes a bug when cancelling jobs. Stuck jobs were only removed from
the queue, but their cancel routine was not called.</li>
<li>Changes in cancelling process-item jobs: the item will still be
created and not removed.</li>
<li>Fixes a bug where items could not be deleted if there were sent
mails attached.</li>
<li>Fixes the openapi spec for the joex component. This made the
generated live documentation unusable.</li>
<li>Changes to the <code>consumedir.sh</code> script:

<li>Add webui settings for the user. These settings only apply to the
web client and are stored in the browser's local storage.</li>
<li>Enable paging in the item list view. The page size can be set in the
new client settings. If the number of results is equal to this size,
a button at the end of the page allows to load more.</li>
<li>The item list now contains all tags of an item.</li>
<li>The tag colors can be customized in the client settings. A color per
tag <em>category</em> can be defined.</li>
<li>New meta data (tags, correspondents, concerned entities) can be
created directly in the item detail view (see #138). No need to
navigate away to the <em>Manage Data</em> page.</li>

<li>Allow to have multiple notify-due-items tasks.</li>
<li>New <em>simple search</em> feature: The list view now appears without the
search menu by default. A search bar is shown instead that allows to
search in item name and notes and in names of correspondents and
concerned entities. The search menu can be opened as before. The
<em>name</em> search field now only searches in item names (as before
0.3.0), i.e. it doesn't search item notes anymore, which is now
possible with the <em>allNames</em> search field.</li>
<li>Fixes a bug where a search term was not lower-cased but compared to
a lower-cased value (see #147).</li>
<li>Allow to change names of attachments. </li>
<li>Document how to create a SMTP gateway to docspell and provide a
simple docker based setup. This is a SMTP server that delivers mails
to docspell instead of using a mbox or maildir. It utilises the
integration endpoint.</li>

<ul>
<li>Support for archive files. Archives, for example zip files, contain
the files that should go into docspell. Docspell now extracts
archives and adds the content to an item. The extraction process is
recursive, so there may be zip files in zip files. File types
supported:
<ul>
<li><code>zip</code> every file inside is added to one item as attachment</li>
<li><code>eml</code> (RCF822 E-Mail files) E-mails are considered archives, since
they may contain multiple files (body and attachments).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Periodic Tasks framework: Docspell can now run tasks periodically
based on a schedule. This is not yet exposed to the user, but there
are some system cleanup jobs to start with. </li>
<li>Improvement of the text analysis. For my test files there was a
increase in accuracy by about 10%.</li>
<li>A due date that is found during text analysis is now set on the
item. If multiple due dates are found, the earliest one is used.</li>
<li>Allow to switch between viewerjs PDF viewer or the browser's builtin
viewer.</li>
<li>Bug fixes related to handling text files.</li>
<li>Add a configurable length limit for text analysis</li>
